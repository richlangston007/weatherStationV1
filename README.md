weatherStationV1
================
Arduino code for my first weather station project

Project uses 3 Adafruit 7 segment LED backpacks, 
along with two 24 segment LED bars

Incorporates a ChronoDot RTC for time keeping

Adafruit BMP180 Pressure Sensor used for temp and barometric pressure

All these components talk using I2C serial

Includes a toggle switch which is used to toggle between 
daylight savings time (summer time) and standard time.
